# Agent Coordination

Why do teams of LLM agents fail at coding tasks, and which fix is most cost-effective for each cause of failure?

## Overview

Two agents each implement one feature, and their code is merged at the end. A run can fail for four reasons:

- **Capability**: the task is beyond what the model can do.
- **Context**: after the task is split, an agent lacks information it needs for its own part.
- **Coordination**: agents duplicate work or don't know what the other is changing.
- **Integration**: each agent's code is correct on its own, but the two don't merge.

Each cause calls for a different fix. We first measure how often each cause occurs, then compare targeted interventions for the main causes, and finally ask whether the cause can be predicted while a run is still in progress. Tasks and tests come from [CooperBench](https://github.com/cooperbench/CooperBench).

| Stage | Question | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Exploration | Build the experiment pipeline | Done, see [M0 retrospective](docs/M0_RETROSPECTIVE.md) |
| S1 Failure census | Which causes produce failures, and how often? | Done: integration is the main cause |
| S2 Targeted interventions | Does a fix matched to the cause beat other fixes? | Design drafted |
| S3 Online diagnosis | Can we detect the cause mid-run and pick a fix? | After S2 |

The full design is in the [research plan](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md).

## Findings so far

S1 main run: gpt-6-luna, 53 tasks, 3 coop and 3 solo runs each, 318 runs in total, $2.32.

- Coop passed 35 / 159. Of the 124 failures, 84 (68%) were integration failures, and 82 of those were git merge conflicts: both agents wrote correct code but edited the same lines. If each feature counted as passed whenever its own patch passed, coop would pass 85 / 159.
- Capability caused 18 failures (15%) and context 21. A secondary handoff label moves 13 of these 39: to avoid merge conflicts, an agent left part of its feature to its partner, and the combined work failed.
- Solo officially passed only 27 / 159, but another 62 runs wrote correct code and never opened a PR. CooperBench only grades submitted code.

The pre-registered condition for continuing (non-capability causes ≥ 30% of failures) is met at 86%. Details, confidence intervals and the go_chi/typst caveat are in the [research plan](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md#s1-main-run-2026-11-02).

Offline merge test: we re-merged the existing patch pairs of the 88 coop runs whose merge conflicted. No agent was re-run, and the whole test cost $0.02.

- With gpt-6-luna resolving the conflicts, 112 of 134 integration features (84%) pass. Coop then passes 78 / 159 instead of 35, close to solo's 89 when unsubmitted code is counted.
- Keeping both sides of each conflict (git's union merge) recovers only 51.
- After the merge, about half of the remaining coop failures are capability. See the [research plan](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md#offline-merge-test-2026-11-02).

Per-run data: [S1 main](results/s1_main_rows.csv), [S1 screening](results/s1_screen_rows.csv), [merge test](results/merge_test_rows.csv).

## Quick start

These commands need only Python 3.9+, with no Docker or API key:

```bash
python3 scripts/project.py census                               # failure causes in M0 runs
python3 scripts/project.py s1 configs/s1_main.json --report     # S1 main results (needs local run logs)
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Running S1 experiments requires Docker, Redis, and an OpenAI API key. See [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
