# Agent Coordination

Why do teams of LLM agents fail at coding tasks, and which fix is most cost-effective for each cause of failure?

## Overview

Two agents each implement one feature, and their code is merged at the end. A run can fail for four reasons:

- **Capability**: the task is beyond what the model can do.
- **Context**: after the task is split, an agent lacks information it needs for its own part.
- **Coordination**: agents duplicate work or don't know what the other is changing.
- **Integration**: each agent's code is correct on its own, but the two don't merge.

We started from the hypothesis that each cause calls for a different fix. We first measure how often each cause occurs, then compare targeted interventions for the main causes, and finally ask whether the cause can be predicted while a run is still in progress. Tasks and tests come from [CooperBench](https://github.com/cooperbench/CooperBench).

| Stage | Question | Status |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Exploration | Build the experiment pipeline | Done, see [M0 retrospective](docs/M0_RETROSPECTIVE.md) |
| S1 Failure census | Which causes produce failures, and how often? | Done: integration is the main cause |
| S2 Targeted interventions | Does a fix matched to the cause beat other fixes? | Done: no fix beats the baseline once conflicts are merged |
| S3 Online diagnosis | Can we detect the cause mid-run and pick a fix? | Not going ahead as planned |

The full design is in the [research plan](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md).

## Findings so far

S1 main run: gpt-6-luna, 53 tasks, 3 coop and 3 solo runs each, 318 runs in total, $2.32.

- Coop passed 35 / 159. Of the 124 failures, 84 (68%) were integration failures, and 82 of those were git merge conflicts: both agents wrote correct code but edited the same lines. If each feature counted as passed whenever its own patch passed, coop would pass 85 / 159.
- Capability caused 18 failures (15%) and context 21. A secondary handoff label moves 13 of these 39: to avoid merge conflicts, an agent left part of its feature to its partner, and the combined work failed.
- Solo officially passed only 27 / 159, but another 62 runs wrote correct code and never opened a PR. CooperBench only grades submitted code.

The pre-registered condition for continuing (non-capability causes ≥ 30% of failures) is met at 86%. Details, confidence intervals and the go_chi/typst caveat are in the [research plan](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md#s1-main-run-2026-11-02).

Offline merge test: we re-merged the existing patch pairs of the 88 coop runs whose merge conflicted. No agent was re-run, and the whole test cost $0.02.

- With gpt-6-luna resolving the conflicts, 112 of 134 integration features (84%) pass. Coop then passes 78 / 159 instead of 35, close to solo's 89 when unsubmitted code is counted.
- Keeping both sides of each conflict (git's union merge) recovers only 51.
- After the merge, about half of the remaining coop failures are capability. See the [research plan](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md#offline-merge-test-2026-11-02).

S2: the same 53 tasks, 3 runs each in four arms, 636 runs in total, $6.42. Conflicted coop runs are re-merged with the merge test's llm method, and that score is primary.

- The baseline passes 88 / 159 after the re-merge, against 38 officially.
- Telling agents that overlapping edits are merged automatically (own-feature) cuts handoff failures from 14 to 3, but more conflicts follow and integration failures the re-merge cannot fix rise from 11 to 29. Net: −3.1 points against the baseline [−11.3, +5.0].
- A shared git remote does not reduce context failures, and capability failures rise. Net: −4.4 [−10.7, +1.9].
- On CooperBench's official score, shared git would beat the baseline by 10.7 points [+3.1, +18.9]. About half of that gain comes from the conflict fallback, which tests agent 1's patch alone after agent 1 has pulled in its partner's code. The scoring rule changes the verdict on the intervention. See the [research plan](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md#s2-targeted-interventions-2026-11-03).

"Official score" above means the released CooperBench harness (`git merge`, then agent 1's patch alone on a conflict). The CooperBench paper used a gentler pipeline: `git merge-file`, a union merge, then a small learned resolver.

The CooperBench paper's own runs (GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5, published on Hugging Face): we re-checked the paper's results without re-running any agent. This used Docker and a few cents of re-merging.

- **The paper's merge step often loses code.** In most pairs it recorded as merging cleanly, the merged patch it tested holds only agent 2's code: agent 1's work never entered the merge. We tested the paper's own merged patches in our harness. They reproduce its failures: 62 of 64, with the same first error in 55 of 56. Control pairs the paper recorded as passing pass for us too.
- **Merged for real, conflicts are common.** 48% of GPT-5's failed pairs and 74% of Claude's conflict, against the 30% and 21% the paper recorded. We withdraw our earlier reading that strong models rarely conflict and fail mostly on code that merges cleanly.
- **Most of the coop–solo gap is a merge artifact.** We corrected every merge problem: conflicts resolved by our llm re-merge, lost code restored. On pairs with a solo run, coop success then rises from 28.6% to 40.4% for GPT-5 and from 23.5% to 42.9% for Claude, against solo's 45.8% and 46.2%. That closes 68% and 85% of the gap. Conflicts are resolved with gpt-6-luna, which may be stronger than the paper's resolver.
- **What remains.** Among the remaining failures that solo avoids, an agent failing its own feature when paired is the largest cause. Integration is 23% (GPT-5) and 36% (Claude).
- **A smaller bug.** CooperBench counts a test run as failed if "failed" appears anywhere in its output. The paper used this check (it reproduces all 2,211 recorded results), but it changes only 6 of them.

Details, in order: the [offline check](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md#offline-check-on-the-cooperbench-papers-runs-2026-11-03), the [failure census](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md#failure-census-on-the-papers-runs-2026-11-04), [re-scoring the logs](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md#re-scoring-the-papers-test-logs-2026-11-04), the [merged-patch check](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md#the-papers-merged-patches-tested-in-our-harness-2026-11-04) and the [merge audit](docs/RESEARCH_PLAN.md#audit-of-the-papers-clean-merges-2026-11-04).

## Quick start

These commands need only Python 3.9+, with no Docker or API key:

```bash
python3 scripts/project.py census                               # failure causes in M0 runs
python3 scripts/project.py s1 configs/s1_main.json --report     # S1 main results (needs local run logs)
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Running S1 experiments requires Docker, Redis, and an OpenAI API key. See [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
